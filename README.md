## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DoktorShift/naughtify.git
cd naughtify
```

### Step 2: Installing Dependencies in a Virtual Environment

The dependencies are installed in a virtual environment so that they are isolated from the system. Even ‚Äúpip‚Äù is not installed on every system from the outset, so here are a few preparations.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install python3-venv
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Now we set up a virtual environment, activate it and install the dependencies in it.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

__Note:__ You can deactivate the editing mode of the virtual environment. It remains valid for the application. To reactivate the editing mode for the virtual environment, e.g. to update a dependency, you must first select the folder to which the virtual environment applies and then activate the virtual environment. 

```bash
# deactivate venv editing
deactivate
# activate venv editing
cd ~/naughtify
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Configure the Environment

Settings are applied and parameters are transferred here.

1. Copy the `.env` and open it.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoktorShift/naughtify/refs/heads/main/example.env
mv example.env .env
sudo nano .env
```

2. Fill in at least the first four fields of the template:

- Telegram Bot Token
- Chat ID (User ID)
- LNBIts Readonly key
- LNBits Server URL

These are heavily needed

### Step 4: Setting Up Caddy Web Server

To expose the Flask app and enable inline commands, the Telegram bot must be able to reach the server. To do this, we use a subdomain, such as naughtify.yourdomain.com. Caddy then only needs to be set up as a reverse proxy on the server.

__Important:__ Make sure that you point the DNS addresses (A and AAAA, if applicable) of your subdomain/domain to the IP address of your Virtual Private Server so that the requests are forwarded to the VPS via the domain. If you do not yet have a domain, you can obtain a free subdomain from duckdns.org.  

#### Step a: Install Caddy

```bash
sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install caddy
```

-> Test the web server in your internet browser with: http://yourIPaddress. You should see a Caddy web page.

#### Step b: Configure the Caddyfile

Create and open your Caddyfile

```bash
 sudo nano /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
 ```

Fill the file with the following content and update `yourdomain.com` in one place:

```plaintext
# Configuration for Naughtify
naughtify.yourdomain.com {
    # Reverse proxy for webhook endpoints
    reverse_proxy /webhook* 127.0.0.1:5009

    # Reverse proxy for all other routes
    reverse_proxy * 127.0.0.1:5009

    # Enable GZIP compression
    encode gzip

    # Security headers
    header {
        Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
        X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
        X-Frame-Options "DENY"
        Referrer-Policy "no-referrer-when-downgrade"
        Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self'; font-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self';"
    }
}
```

#### Step c: Reload Caddy

Restart or reload Caddy to apply the changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

If you now call up the web domain in the browser, you should see a `HTTP ERROR 502` error. This means that it reaches the Caddy server, but the forwarding to Naughtify fails. Which is no wonder, as Naughtify has not yet started. Later you will a white page with `üîç LNbits Monitor is running.`.

If you still have a problem, the following commands may help with debugging:

```bash
sudo systemctl status caddy
sudo journalctl -u caddy -f --since "2 hour ago"
```

You can check whether the forwarding works, for example, with this: https://dnschecker.org/ <br>
The SSL certificate e.g. with this: https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html

### Step 5: Telegram Bot Webhook Setup

To enable inline commands (like `/balance`, `/transactions`, `/info`), connect your Telegram bot to the app:

1. **Prepare Your Webhook URL:**  
   Combine your domain with the `/webhook` endpoint.  
   Example:  
   ```
   https://naughtify.example.com/webhook
   ```

2. **Set the Webhook:**  
   Replace placeholders below with your **Telegram Bot Token** and **Webhook URL**:

   - **Using a Web Browser:**  
     ```
     https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>
     ```
     Example:  
     ```
     https://api.telegram.org/bot123456:ABCDEF/setWebhook?url=https://naughtify.example.com/webhook
     ```

   - **Using cURL (Command Line):**  
     ```bash
     curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>"
     ```

3. **Verify the Webhook:**  
   Telegram should confirm:  
   ```json
   {
     "ok": true,
     "result": true,
     "description": "Webhook was set"
   }
   ```

---

### Step 6: Start the Application

```bash
python naughtify.py
```
Output:
```plaintext

[2024-11-28 15:14:32,759] [INFO] üöÄ Starting LNbits Balance Monitor.

```

### Step 7: Naughtify Autostart Service

1. Create new system service:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/naughtify.service
```

2. Fill in the file with the following information and customize `youruser` in __five__ places:

```plaintext
[Unit]
Description=Naughtify
After=network.target

[Service]
User=youruser
WorkingDirectory=/home/youruser/naughtify
EnvironmentFile=/home/youruser/naughtify/.env
ExecStart=/home/youruser/naughtify/venv/bin/python /home/youruser/naughtify/naughtify.py
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Activate, start and monitor:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable naughtify
sudo systemctl start naughtify
sudo systemctl status naughtify
```

From now on, naughtify will start automatically with every restart. üéâ

However, if you have problems, you can call up the logs with the following command:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u naughtify -f --since "2 hour ago"
```

## OPTIONAL Additions

### Option: Deploy Overwatch

Follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/DoktorShift/Overwatch)

Option 1: Self Deployment (Vue/Quasar) [here](https://github.com/DoktorShift/Overwatch/blob/main/DEPLOYMENT.md)

Option 2: Easier Deployment with Netlify [here](https://github.com/DoktorShift/Overwatch/blob/main/DEPLOYMENT_Netlify.md)

### Option: LiveTicker üì∫

Naughtify can also provide a simple public website that displays the data and transactions of a wallet. This function is called ‚ÄúLiveTicker‚Äù. Examples of this would be a donation page or a crowdfunding page. Anyone can view the page, send funds directly, leave a comment (if desired) and shortly afterwards see that their contribution with the comment has been received. If activated, the entire wallet balance is also displayed, which can be particularly necessary for crowdfunding projects and ensures absolute transparency.

To use the LiveTicker, you need another subdomain via which the website can later be accessed. At the hosting provider, the A (and AAAA) entry for e.g. ‚Äúliveticker.yourdomomain.com‚Äù must point to the server on which Naughtify is installed. The .env file must then be adapted accordingly and the entry added to Caddy.

__Call the .env to edit the data:__

```bash
sudo nano ~/naughtify/.env
```

Adjust the following values in the `LiveTicker Configuration` area:

```plaintext
DONATIONS_URL=YourLiveTickerPageURL <- liveticker.yourdomomain.com
LNURLP_ID=YourLNURPID <- The ID (6 letters) of the Pay Link instance
```

__Extend the caddy file:__

```bash
sudo nano /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

Add the following content to the end of the file and customize `yourdomain.com` in one place: 

```plaintext
# Configuration for LiveTicker
liveticker.yourdomain.com {
    # Matcher for the root request
    @root path /

    # Rewriting the root request to /liveticker
    rewrite @root /donations

    # Reverse proxy for all requests
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:5009

    # Activate GZIP compression
    encode gzip

    # Set security header
    header {
        Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
        X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
        X-Frame-Options "DENY"
        Referrer-Policy "no-referrer-when-downgrade"
        Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src >    }
}
```

Reload Caddy to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

If you now call up your domain `liveticker.yourdomain.com`, you should see your LiveTicker website. üì∫
